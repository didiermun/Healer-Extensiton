# Healer-Extensiton


Creating a chome extension is simple and straightforward
this is a simple example of a chrome extension

it contain 3 basic files

manifest.json: which is a file that tells chrome what to do with our extension that we are providing to it and it is required in all chrome extensions folders
popup.html: which is the html page to be loaded when our extension icon is clicked.
popup.js: chrome does not allow inline javascript for security reasons so, we create another js file to contain the logic of our extension

You will also find that we have an icon in the assets folder that we use as an icon in browser

To import extension in your browser:
1. use this url "chrome://extensions" 
2.Enable developer mode
3.Load unpacked and browser your root folder.

Once you have finished this. Browser any page and then choose this extension. It will open a new tab to  Gmetrix for analysis

All set thank you
